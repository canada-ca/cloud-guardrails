# Management of Administrative Privileges

## Objective

Establish access control policies and procedures for management of administrative privileges.

## Key Considerations

* [ ] Document a process for managing accounts, access privileges, and access credentials for organizational users, non-organizational users (if required), and processes based on the principles of separation of duties and least privilege (for example, operational procedures and active directory).
* [ ] Implement a mechanism for enforcing access authorizations.
* [ ] Implement a mechanism for uniquely identifying and authenticating organizational users, non-organizational users (if applicable), and processes (for example, username and password).
* [ ] Implement a multi-factor authentication mechanism for privileged accounts (for example, username, password and one-time password) and for external facing interfaces.
* [ ] Change default passwords.
* [ ] Ensure that no custom subscription owner roles are created.
* [ ] Configure password policy in accordance with [GC Password Guidance](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/online-security-privacy/password-guidance.html).
* [ ] Minimize number of guest users; add only if needed.
* [ ] Determine access restrictions and configuration requirements for GC-issued endpoint devices, including those of non-privileged and privileged users, and configure access restrictions for endpoint devices accordingly.
**Note:** Some service providers may offer configuration options to restrict endpoint device access. Alternatively, organizational policy and procedural instruments can be implemented to restrict access.

## Validation

* [ ] Confirm policy for MFA is enabled through screenshots and compliance reports.
* [ ] Confirm that a privileged account management plan and process has been documented.
* [ ] Confirm password policy aligns with [GC Password Guidance](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/online-security-privacy/password-guidance.html) as appropriate.

## Additional Considerations

* [ ] Leverage enterprise services such as Administrative Access Controls Service (AACS) for Privileged Access Management (PAM), Attribute-based access control (ABAC).

## Applicable Service Models

* IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
