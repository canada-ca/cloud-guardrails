# Protect Root / Global Admins Account

([Back](/README.md#summary---initial-30-days))

## Objective

Protect root or master account used to establish the cloud service.

## Key Considerations

* [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanism for root/master account.
* [ ] Document a break glass emergency account management procedure. Including names of users with root or master account access.
* [ ] Obtain signature from Departmental Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Chief Security Officer (CSO) to confirm acknowledgement and approval of the break glass emergency account management procedures.
* [ ] Implement a mechanism for enforcing access authorizations.
* [ ] Configure appropriate alerts on root/master accounts to detect a potential compromise, in accordance with the [GC Event Logging Guidance](https://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/gcwiki/images/e/e3/GC_Event_Logging_Strategy.pdf)

## Validation

* [ ] Confirm policy for MFA is enabled through screenshots and compliance reports.
* [ ] Confirm that an attestation letter of the emergency break glass procedure has been signed by the Departmental CIO and CSO.

## Additional Considerations

* [ ] Leverage enterprise services such as Administrative Access Control System (AACS) for Privileged Access Management (PAM), Attribute-based access control (ABAC).

## Applicable Service Models

* IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
