# Logging and Monitoring

([Back](/README.md#summary---initial-30-days))

## Objective

Enable logging for the cloud environment and for cloud-based workloads.

## Key Considerations

* [ ] Implement adequate level of logging and reporting, including a security audit log function in all information systems.
* [ ] Identify the events within the solution that must be audited in accordance with [GC Event Logging](https://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/gcwiki/images/e/e3/GC_Event_Logging_Strategy.pdf).

**Note:** You may need to configure your solution to send the audit log records to a centralized logging facility, if one is available, where existing auditing mechanisms will be applied.

* [ ] Configure alerts and notifications to be sent to the appropriate contact/team in the organization.
* [ ] Configure or use an authoritative time source for the time-stamp of the audit records generated by your solution components.
* [ ] Continuously monitor system events and performance.

## Validation

* [ ] Confirm policy for event logging is implemented.
* [ ] Confirm event logs are being generated.
* [ ] Confirm that security contact information has been configured to receive alerts and notifications.

## Applicable Service Models

* IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
