# Cloud Console Access

([Back](/README.md#summary---initial-30-days))

## Objective

Limit access to GC managed devices and authorized users.

## Key Considerations

* [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication mechanism for privileged accounts and remote network (cloud) access.
* [ ] Determine access restrictions and configuration requirements for GC managed devices, including those of non-privileged and privileged users, and configure access restrictions for endpoint devices accordingly.

**Note:** Some service providers may offer configuration options to restrict endpoint device access. Alternatively, organizational policy and procedural instruments can be implemented to restrict access.

* [ ] Ensure that administrative actions are performed by authorized users following a process approved by Chief Security Officer (CSO) (or delegate) and designated official for cyber security. This process should incorporate the use of trusted devices and a risk-based conditional access control policy with appropriate logging and monitoring enabled.
* [ ] Implement a mechanism for enforcing access authorizations.
* [ ] Implement password protection mechanisms to protect against password brute force attacks.

## Validation

* [ ] Confirm policy for MFA is enabled through screenshots and compliance reports.

## Additional Considerations

* [ ] Leverage enterprise services such as Administrative Access Control System (AACS) for Privileged Access Management (PAM), Attributed-based access control (ABAC).

## Applicable Service Models

* IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
